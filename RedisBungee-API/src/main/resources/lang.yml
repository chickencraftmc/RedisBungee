# this config file is for messages / Languages
# use MiniMessage format https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html
# for colors etc... Legacy chat color is not supported.

# Language codes used in minecraft from the minecraft wiki
# example: en-us for american english and ar-sa for arabic

# all codes can be obtained from link below
# from the colum Locale Code -> In-game
# NOTE: minecraft wiki shows languages like this `en_us` in config it should be `en-us`
# https://minecraft.wiki/w/Language

# example:
# lets assume we want to add arabic language.
# messages:
#    logged-in-other-location:
#      en-us: "<color:red>You logged in from another location!"
#      ar-sa: "<color:red>لقد اتصلت من مكان اخر"


# RedisBungee Prefix if ever used.
prefix: "<color:red>[<color:yellow>Redis<color:red>Bungee]"

# en-us is american English, Which is the default language used when a language for a message isn't defined.
# Warning: IF THE set default locale wasn't defined in the config for all messages, plugin will not load.
# set the Default locale
default-locale: en-us

# send language based on client sent settings
# if you don't have languages configured For client Language
# it will default to language that has been set above
# NOTE: due minecraft protocol not sending player settings during login,
# some of the messages like logged-in-other-location will
# skip translation and use default locale that has been set in default-locale.
use-client-locale: true

# messages that are used during login, and connecting to Last server
